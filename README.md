# Features Implemented so far:

## Core Algorithm
- Perlin Noise Flow Field - Particles follow vectors generated from 3D Perlin noise
- Particle System - Thousands of particles with individual trails and behaviors
- Real-time Updates - All parameters update instantly as you adjust sliders

## Interactive Controls
- Noise Scale - Controls the "squigglyness" of paths (0.001-0.02)
- Particle Speed - Velocity control (0.1-10)
- Particle Count - Density control (500-5000 particles)
- Trail Length - Controls how long trails remain visible
- 6 Color Palettes - Neon Night, Ocean Mist, Monochrome, Desert Sunset, Enchanted Forest, Cyberpunk
- Particle Size - Adjusts visual weight
- Flow Strength - Controls force magnitude

## Export Functionality
- Export PNG - High-resolution raster export
- Export SVG - Vector export using p5.svg.js library
- Randomize Button - Creates surprising new configurations

## Creative Features
- Click anywhere to reset particles from that point
- Time-based color animations
- Screen wrapping for continuous flow
- Trail history system for smooth lines
- Animated Perlin noise (z-offset over time)

## How to Use:
- Save the code as index.html
- Open in browser - that's it! No build process needed
- Adjust sliders to see real-time changes
- Click Export for PNG or SVG
- Try Randomize for unexpected results
- Click canvas to reset particles from mouse position
